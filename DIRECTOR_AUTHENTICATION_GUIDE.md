# Director Authentication Guide - CampusConnect

## Overview
This guide explains how directors can register and authenticate in the CampusConnect system, including both signup and login processes.

## üîê **Director Registration (Signup)**

### **Method 1: Through Main Signup Form**
Directors can register using the main signup form with the following steps:

1. **Navigate to Signup Page**: Go to `/signup`
2. **Fill Basic Information**:
   - Full Name
   - Email Address
   - Password
   - College Name
   - Profile Image (optional)
3. **Select Role**: Choose "Director" from the role dropdown
4. **Additional Director Fields** (appear when Director role is selected):
   - **Director Role**: Select from:
     - Campus Director
     - Department Director
     - Academic Director
     - Administrative Director
   - **Department**: Enter department name
5. **Submit**: Click "Sign Up" to create the account

### **Method 2: Direct Director Signup**
Directors can also use the dedicated director signup component at `/director-signup` which includes:
- Director-specific styling
- Pre-selected director role options
- Enhanced form validation
- Professional appearance

### **Backend Process**
When a director signs up:
1. **User Creation**: A new user is created with `role: 'Director'`
2. **Director Details**: A separate Director document is created with:
   - Director role and permissions
   - Department information
   - Administrative capabilities
3. **College Association**: Director is linked to their campus
4. **Profile Setup**: Basic profile information is stored

## üîë **Director Login**

### **Method 1: Universal Login**
Directors can login through the main login page at `/Login`:
- The system automatically detects the user role
- Directors are redirected to `/director-panel` after successful login
- Other users (students, faculty, alumni) go to `/DashBoard`

### **Method 2: Dedicated Director Login**
Directors can use the dedicated login page at `/director-login`:
- Professional director-themed interface
- Direct access to director panel
- Enhanced security features
- Role-specific styling

### **Login Flow**
1. **Email/Password**: Enter credentials
2. **Role Detection**: System identifies user as director
3. **Authentication**: Backend validates credentials
4. **Session Creation**: JWT token or session is created
5. **Redirect**: User is taken to Director Panel
