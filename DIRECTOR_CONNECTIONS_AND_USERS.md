# Director Connections & User Management - Complete Implementation

## üéØ **Overview**

I've successfully implemented the requested functionality to:
1. **Fix `getDirectorConnections`** - Now fetches only campus directors
2. **Create separate controllers** for fetching students, alumni, and faculty of the same college
3. **Enhanced Director Panel** with role-based user management tabs

## üîß **Backend Implementation**

### **1. Fixed `getDirectorConnections` Function**

**Location**: `Backend/controllers/Director.controller.js`

**Changes Made**:
```javascript
// Before: Fetched directors AND faculty
const connections = await User.find({
    college: userCollege,
    _id: { $ne: userId },
    role: { $in: ['Director', 'Faculty'] }
});

// After: Fetches ONLY directors
const directors = await User.find({
    college: userCollege,
    _id: { $ne: userId },
    role: 'Director'
}).populate('directorDetails');
```

**Enhanced Response**:
```javascript
{
    success: true,
    users: [
        {
            userId: "director_id",
            name: "Director Name",
            profileImage: "image_url",
            role: "Director",
